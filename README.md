# ChloeDiscordBot
A Discord bot I wrote for my Epic7 guild's Discord server.

Chloe bot works by parsing '$search' commands written by Discord server members followed by a character name.
The requested character name is checked against the website of an Epic7 fansite that has information for each character, then returns a URL directly into the chat.
She also reminds Discord server members on certain scheduled days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of guild war taking place that day.
