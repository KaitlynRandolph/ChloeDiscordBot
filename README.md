# ChloeDiscordBot
A Discord bot I wrote for my Epic7 guild's Discord server.

Features:
- Works by parsing `$search` commands written by Discord server members followed by a character name. Checks the requested name against an Epic7 fansite to see if it returns an info page, then returns a URL directly into the chat.<br>
- Also reminds Discord server members on certain scheduled days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of guild war taking place that day.
