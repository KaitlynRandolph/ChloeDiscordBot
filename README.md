# ChloeDiscordBot
A Discord bot I wrote for my Epic7 guild's Discord server.

Features:
- Works by parsing `$c` commands written by Discord server members followed by a character name. Checks the requested name against an Epic7 fansite to see if it returns an info page, then returns a URL directly into the chat.<br>
- Also reminds Discord server members on certain scheduled days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of guild war taking place that day.
- Also, users may use `$a` to search for artifacts that can be equipped to characters in-game.
- She will greet new members to the guild's Discord server.
- There are `$hello` and `$help` commands to allow interaction with the bot and give information about her functionality.

Future Features:
- Scraping web page to generate a plaintext message with key information about the searched character.
